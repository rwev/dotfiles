# dotfiles

Minimal, fast zsh configuration.

## What's included

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **[pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)** | Minimal async prompt — shows git status, last command duration, virtualenv |
| **[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)** | Fish-like inline suggestions from history |
| **[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)** | Highlight valid commands green, bad commands red |
| **[zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)** | Type part of a command, use ↑/↓ to search matching history |
| **[zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)** | Hundreds of extra tab-completion definitions |
| **[zsh-z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)** | Jump to frecent directories: `z proj` |
| **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** | Fuzzy search: Ctrl-R (history), Ctrl-T (files), Alt-C (cd) |
| **[antidote](https://antidote.sh)** | Fast static plugin manager |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```

Re-login (or `exec zsh`) to start using zsh.

### Dry run first

```bash
bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh --dry-run
```

## Key bindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | Search history by what you've typed (substring search) |
| `Ctrl-P` / `Ctrl-N` | Same as ↑/↓ |
| `Ctrl-Space` | Accept autosuggestion |
| `Ctrl-R` | Fuzzy search command history (fzf) |
| `Ctrl-T` | Fuzzy insert file path |
| `Alt-C` | Fuzzy cd into a directory |
| `Ctrl-→` / `Ctrl-←` | Jump forward/backward by word |

## Usage tips

### z — directory jumping

```bash
# After visiting ~/projects/my-app a few times:
z my-app        # jumps there
z app           # partial match
z -l            # list all frecent dirs
```

### Machine-local config

`install.sh` symlinks the tracked config to `~/.zshrc.core`, and leaves
`~/.zshrc` as a real, untracked file that just does `source
"$HOME/.zshrc.core"`. That's deliberate: installers (nvm, bun, etc.)
universally append PATH exports and init lines to `~/.zshrc` by convention —
since it's untracked, that churn never touches the repo. Anything you want to
add by hand (tokens, work-specific paths) goes there too.

## AI agent configuration

Shared content lives in `.agents/`. Thin adapters install it in each CLI's native
format. The installer does not install AI tools or manage credentials, sessions,
caches, or other runtime state. It does not link whole harness directories.

### What is portable

No global directory is read by every AI CLI. Project-root `AGENTS.md` is a shared
working-instruction convention. Our `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` is a canonical source,
not a universally discovered global instruction file.

Skills use the standard `SKILL.md` format: YAML metadata followed by Markdown.
The specification defines the format, not one mandatory installation path.
The integration guide recommends `.agents/skills` for shared discovery.
See the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and
[integration guide](https://agentskills.io/client-implementation/adding-skills-support).
